    <h2>Wild hyacinth: This bulbflower naturalizes well in gardens. The bulb grows best in well-drained soil high in humus.<br>
        It will grow in lightly shaded forest areas and on rocky outcrops as well as in open meadows or prairies.<br>
        Additionally it is found growing alongside streams and rivers. The plants may be divided in autumn after the leaves have withered.<br>
        Bulbs should be planted in the autumn. Additionally the plant spreads by seed rather than by runners.</h2>

        spreading readily and rapidly, and anyone who gardens in a small space will want to watch this perennial to make sure it stays in bounds.<br>
        Tolerates shade well. <strong>Warning: this plant is poisonous.</strong></h2>

        numerous flowering stems with slender, deeply green foliage. Blooms are fragrant and star shaped with six blue or white petals.</h2>
